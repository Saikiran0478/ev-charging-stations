# Option A: Using a pre-trained Hugging Face model (e.g., for sentiment analysis on reviews, or a custom text-based recommender)
# Try to find a model on Hugging Face that *might* be relevant, even if it's not a perfect "EV charge locator."
# For a real EV charge locator, you'd likely need to train your own model or use a specialized API.
# For demonstration, let's pretend we have a simple "ranking" model.
try:
    # If you have a custom model hosted on Hugging Face or locally:
    # Example: a model that takes location context and returns a score for a hypothetical charging station.
    # This is highly speculative and would need to be replaced with a real model.
    # For a real application, you'd train a model that takes features like location,
    # time of day, desired amenities, and outputs a recommendation score or probability of availability.

    # Example of a *dummy* Hugging Face model for demonstration:
    # Let's imagine a model that predicts "user happiness score" for a station based on text input.
    # This is NOT an EV locator, but demonstrates the integration.
    # For a real EV locator, you'd need a dataset of stations and train a model on features.
    # As a placeholder, let's use a sentiment analysis model to "score" a fictional description.

**Note on AI Model:** The AI model integration in this example uses a simple sentiment analysis model as a placeholder to demonstrate how a Hugging Face model can be incorporated. For a real-world EV charge locator, you would need to train or fine-tune a model specifically for this task, likely using datasets containing features like station popularity, historical availability, pricing, amenities, and user reviews.
